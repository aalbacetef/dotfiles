        I prefer using Podman over Docker because the rootless mode is fantastic. 
        There are some downsides with it like talking with the outside world is more difficult
        which is why I don't alias docker.
      options:
        override-socket: true
        aliases: []           # to alias to docker just use ["docker"]
